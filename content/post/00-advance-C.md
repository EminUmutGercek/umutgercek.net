## How much advanced content can come from novice programmer {#how-much-advanced-content-can-come-from-novice-programmer}

While I was learning C  I couldn't find **semi-** advance tutorial on internet.<br />
Above sentence is wrong. Because there is literally everything on internet.<br />
So how could i end up with no content?<br />
Because I tended to learn C not other things like OS internals, embedded programming.
Nowadays I'm reading [The Linux Programming Interface](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200). So I study between between the territory OS internals and C.
There were lots of times that I said this is fun I should have learned this way before.
This series is for that. It's primary focus will be C not OS.
But if you don't like OS you won't like it.
If you are using POSIX comptatible OS like GNU/Linux, \*BSD, macOS you are fine.
For Windows if you use mingw you are probably fine.
I will try these for Windows one they but know I'm too lazy for that.
